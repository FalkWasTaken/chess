# Chess Engines in Rust + React Frontend

This is a hobby-project where I document my "chess-engine-journey". I write engines in Rust and combine that with a frontend written in JavaScript and React. The engines run on a rocket server and listen to requests with FEN descriptions of chess positions. It can then generate a move and respond to the front end.
